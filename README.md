**Introduction:**

The "RISC" in RISC-V stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computer.It's designed to be simple, modular, and extensible, allowing for flexibility in implementing various types of processors, from microcontrollers to high-performance CPUs.It should accommodate all implementation technologies: Field-Programmable Gate
Arrays (**FPGAs**), Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (**ASICs**), full-custom chips,
and even future device technologies.It should be safe so the base ISA cannot be changed.

Function:
  Lets say if a c program has to run on a particular hardware or an interior chip, we have to pass the code to the layout which has certain flow.Firstly the c program is compiled to Assembly language(RISCV - set of instructions consisting hexadecimal numbers).This assembly language is converted into Machine language which is binary language program.
  The interface between RISCV and hardware is Hardware Description language.RTL implements the specifications of RISC.

  The flow for the above description:
